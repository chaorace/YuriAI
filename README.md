#What is AwesomeAI?
AwesomeAI is a WIP AI framework made for Awesomenauts, a commercial game created by Ronimo.

AwesomeAI is a completely rewritten replacement for GeneralAI. AwesomeAI is designed with an emphasis on flexibility, added features, and putting more control in the hands of the modder. It's currently a WIP with no projected release date. Beware though, this new framework requires a different mindset to reap it's benefits

#What can AwesomeAI do that GeneralAI can't?
AwesomeAI provides features that do not exist in GeneralAI such as:
* Map detection: Tailor your AI to the map!
* Turret detection: Always know which turrets are up!
* Node detection: Always know which node you're at!
* Pathfinding scripting: Write and load complex logic-driven pathway files!
* Player detection: Know the health, lane, and class of your allies!
* No states: Unshackle yourself from the state system!

#Is it safe to start making an AI with AwesomeAI?
Yes, but also no. Since AwesomeAI is still evolving, behavior may change in the future. As a rule of thumb, it should be safe to use existing logic, so long as it does not rely on bugs in AwesomeAI. As it stands, AwesomeAI is still very low-level, which means you'll have to write the higher-level decision making logic, like getting to the front lines and fighting, yourself (you can find an example for doing this in the Companion Toolkit). Higher level behavior is coming, so if you'd rather not do that, you can always wait!

#Where's the documentation?
The current existing documentation is very outdated and I plan to update it when things are a bit more solidified. There [b]will[/b] be documentation, it's just not ready yet

#Why is it internally called YuriAI?
I originally created the repo thinking I'd make a Yuri specific AwesomeAI release first, but I decided that would be pretty short-sighted. So, the internal name remains YuriAI, despite the project being AwesomeAI
